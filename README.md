# Parser - A MySQL Compatible SQL Parser

The goal of this project is to build a Golang parser that is fully compatible with MySQL syntax, easy to extend, and high performance. Currently, features supported by parser are as follows:

- Highly compatible with MySQL: it supports almost all features of MySQL. For the complete details, see [parser.y](https://github.com/zr-hebo/parser/blob/master/parser.y) and [hintparser.y](https://github.com/zr-hebo/parser/blob/master/hintparser.y).
- Extensible: adding a new syntax requires only a few lines of Yacc and Golang code changes. As an example, see [PR-680](https://github.com/zr-hebo/parser/pull/680/files).
- Good performance: the parser is generated by goyacc in a bottom-up approach. It is efficient to build an AST tree with a state machine.

It's fork from [TiDB Parser](https://github.com/pingcap/parser), we add some change for our scene.
